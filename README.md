# My .Dotfiles

Very much a WIP  
<br>
**Features:**
- Theme Swap/Background change with [Matugen](https://github.com/InioX/matugen) using [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as image select
- custom weather module in Waybar/Hyprlock using [Brightsky's DWD API](https://github.com/jdemaeyer/brightsky/)
- ...

**TODO:** <br>
  - Shortterm:
    - Update QT5/6 config
    - current YAZI coloring is missmatching
    - complete hyprland modular config structure
  - Longterm:
    - replace and extend widgets using [quickshell](https://github.com/quickshell-mirror/quickshell)

**Notes:**
- Not the full config of my system, only what is needed for the theme changer
- css styling of waybar & rofi app launcher copied from other open configs (forgot exactly where from, but will link them if I come across again) 
- currently using firefox as default browser | to use you need [pywalfox](https://github.com/Frewacom/pywalfox)
- using [awww](https://codeberg.org/LGFae/awww) as wallpaper manager (swww previous, project moved to codeberg)
- Icon Font: [NerdFonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- wallpapers from screenshots found [here](https://wallhaven.cc/) <br>

**Known Issues:**
- matugen will behave sometimes wonky when using pictures with monochromatic color palettes. results in: primary color being blue in mostly white picture, or primary color of green in mostly black picture
- waybar crashing irregularly (have excluded possibility of weather module, maybe specific to my system)

*Beware of dependencies*
